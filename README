NAME
    CPANPLUS::Shell::Default::Plugin::Prereqs - Plugin for CPANPLUS to
    automate the installation of prerequisites without installing the module

SYNOPSIS
      use CPANPLUS::Shell::Default::Plugin::Prereqs;
  
      $ cpanp /prereqs <show|list|install> [Module|URL|dir]

DESCRIPTION
    A plugin for CPANPLUS's default shell which will display and/or install
    any missing prerequisites for a module. The module can be specified by
    name, as a URL or path to the directory of an unpacked module. The
    plugin assumes the current directory if no module is specified.

EXAMPLE COMMAND LINES
    The following would list any reprequsites found in the Build.PL or
    Makefile.PL for the "MyModule" module:

      $ cd MyModule
      $ cpanp /prereqs show .

    Or you could just have given the module name, and "cpanp" will find the
    the module on CPAN:

      $ cpanp /prereqs show YAML

    And of course you can install the prereqs:

      $ cd MyModule
      $ cpanp /prereqs install .

SUBROUTINES
    The module subroutines are primarily expected to be utilized by the
    "CPANPLUS" plugin infrasctructure.

  plugins
    Reports the plugin routines provided by this module.

  install_prereqs
    Performs the reqrequsite listing or installation. Conforms to the
    "CPANPLUS::Shell::Default::Plugins::HOWTO" API.

  install_prereqs_help
    Returns the short version documentation for the plugin.

TODO
    Add test for MakeMaker and Module::Install based modules. Add test for
    /prereq install. Split "install_prereqs" into multiple subroutines.
